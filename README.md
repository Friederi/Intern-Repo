+ This is a storage for all internship work at XXX company.

+ I repeat this is a STORAGE, you are not expected to run any code in this space. You are, however, allowed to write README file as well as requirement.txt file for instruction on how to run your code.

+ For any code you want to test, your branch must be up to date. Pull and merge master branch to your branch before copying the code you desire to run into your own computer's local workspace and testing.
  
+ Any change to file must be done outside this workspace and on your own branch, before replacing changed file, push to your respective branch on repository and then open pull request.
